# React Shaft Calculator

This project was created as part of my high school **Technické Kreslení** (Technical Drawing) class. It serves as a tool for calculating the weight of a shaft, which is a critical component in various engineering calculations. The purpose of the calculator is to simplify the assessment of a shaft's weight to facilitate further calculations in mechanical design.

## Features

* **Shaft Weight Calculation:** Computes the weight of a shaft based on user input, including the shaft's dimensions and material density.
* **Interactive UI:** Built with React, providing an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for users to input values and get results quickly.
* **Unit Conversion:** The calculator supports unit conversion to ensure compatibility with different measurement systems.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thomas032/react-shaft-calculator.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd react-shaft-calculator
```

3. Install the dependencies using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install # or yarn install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

5. Visit the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Enter the shaft's **diameter** and **length** in the respective input fields.
2. Choose the material of the shaft to use its predefined density.
3. Press the **Calculate** button to see the estimated weight of the shaft.
4. Optionally, convert the results into different units for convenience.

## Technologies Used

* **React** for the frontend.
* **JavaScript** for the logic and calculations.
* **CSS** for styling.
